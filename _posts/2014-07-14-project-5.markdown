I love IPython Notebooks because --

* Code + Markdown + LaTeX + inline plots = Awesomeness :)
* Share your code with the community using IPython Notebook Viewer.

Here is a list of IPython Notebooks I have written -

### Computer Vision

* [Face Detection](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/face-detection.ipynb)
* [HSV Thresholding](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/caveat-hsv-thresholding.ipynb)
* [Adaptive Thresholding](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/adaptive-thresholding.ipynb)
* [Connected Components using RGB values](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/connected-components-using-rgb-values.ipynb)
* [Template Matching](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/template-matching.ipynb)
* [Texture Matching using Uniform Local Binary Patterns](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/local-binary-pattern.ipynb)
* [Displaying Video in IPython Notebook](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/computer-vision/displaying-video-in-ipython-notebook.ipynb)

and `more`.

### Machine Learning

* [Digit Recognition using `nolearn`](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/digit_recognition_using_nolearn.ipynb)
* [Cross validation in `scikit-learn`](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/sklearn-cross-validation.ipynb)
* [Pipelining is `scikit-learn`](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/sklearn-pipelining.ipynb)
* [Linear Regression using `Theano` from scratch](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/linear-regression-using-theano.ipynb)
* [Logistic Regression using `Theano` from scratch](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/logistic-regression-using-theano.ipynb)
* [Artifical Neutal Network from scratch](https://github.com/bikz05/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/machine-learning/ann-from-scratch.ipynb)

and `more`.
