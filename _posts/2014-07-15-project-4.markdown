In my final year project -- __Object Transportation Task by a Mobile Robot following a Human__, I worked under Dr. Neelam Rup Prakash. My team partner was Bhopesh Bassi. The project was completed
in a time span of 4 months. We designed the robot from scratch.

# ABSTRACT 

The aim of this project was to build a robot which could track and follow a human for the purpose of object transportation. In modern industry very heavy objects are to be carried around which needs a lot of manual labour, which is both a waste of time and money. Therefore, this robot will find a good application in industry and will be useful in situations where even
conveyer belts cannot be used.

MS Kinect was used to track the human skeleton and the driver user was recoganized using OpenNI library. The Kinect was mounted on a wooden robotic chassis. DC Motors and Arduino board were used to control locomotion of the robot based on position of the human. Gripper Mechanism using
servo motors was used to pick up objects and place them on the robot body.
