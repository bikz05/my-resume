\section*{\color{blue}PROJECTS/WORK EXPERIENCE}

\subsection{Automatic Cameraman for Dynamic Video Acquisition of Football Match }
\subsubsection*{Research Intern -- IRSEEM, France \hfill{\normalfont(January 2013 - July 2013)}}
Designed a system for dynamic video acquisition of football match. Raw frames from static cameras were processed to track the position of players in the field. The tracking data was then used to control an array of Pan Tilt Zoom cameras. \\
\itab{$\bullet$ Research Paper won \textbf{\underline{Best Paper Award}} at \textit{2013 IEEE Second International Conference on Image Information Processing}.}

\subsection{Autonomous Boat}
\subsubsection*{MRSD Project -- NREC-CMU, USA \hfill{\normalfont(September 2015 - present)} } 
Currently working on perception algorithm to track dynamic obstacles like other boats and identify static obstacles like shores using RADAR data, and a path planning algorithm for navigating a boat autonomously. \\
